  <div class="about">
    <h1 class="title">About UBWEB</h1>
    <p class="balls">UBWEB was founded in 2022 by Adam Referee and Nubaid Bugatti as a way to provide students with access to educational resources that are blocked by their schools. Since then, UBWEB has grown to become one of the most popular websites for unblocked games, videos, and other content.</p>
    <p class="balls">UBWEB is committed to providing students with a safe and fun online environment. We believe that every student should have access to the information and resources they need to succeed, regardless of their school's policies.</p>
    <p class="balls">We are always looking for ways to improve UBWEB. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to contact us.</p>
